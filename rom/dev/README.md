## Firmware image bundle

The Caliptra Firmware image has two main components:

- **Firmware manifest**

- **Firmware images**

The firmware manifest is a combination of preamble and a signed header. It has
public keys, public key hashes, signatures and table of contents which refer to the various
firmware images contained in the bundle.

![Firmware Image Bundle](doc/svg/fw-img-bundle.svg)

### Firmware manifest

Firmware manifest consists of preamble, header and table of contents.

#### Preamble

It is the unsigned portion of the manifest. Preamble contains the signing public keys and signatures. ROM is responsible for parsing the preamble. ROM performs the following steps:

- Loads the preamble from the mailbox.
- Calculates the hash of ECC and LMS or MLDSA [Public Key Descriptors](#Public-Key-Descriptor) in the preamble and compares it against the hash in the fuse (FUSE_VENDOR_PK_HASH). If the hashes do not match, the boot fails.
- Verifies the active Manufacturer Public Key(s) based on fuse (FUSE_ECC_REVOCATION for ECC public key, FUSE_LMS_REVOCATION for LMS public key or FUSE_MLDSA_REVOCATION for MLDSA public key)

*Note: All fields are little endian unless specified*

<br>

## Cold reset flow

![COLD RESET](doc/svg/cold-reset.svg)

ROM performs all the necessary crypto derivations on cold reset. No crypto derivations are performed during warm reset or update reset.

Note that KvSlot3 is generally used as a temporary location for derived keying material during ECC keygen.

### Initialization

The initialization step involves a traditional startup script for microcontroller. The initialization script performs following:

- Resets instruction counter
- Disables interrupts
- Clears all general purpose registers
- Sets up memory region attributes (Cacheable & Side effects)
- Sets up stack pointer
- Sets up NMI and Exception handler
- Zeros ICCM & DCCM memories (to initialize ECC)
- Jumps to Rust entry point

The following flows are conducted exclusively when the ROM is operating in ACTIVE mode.

### Manufacturing Flows:
The following flows are conducted when the ROM is operating in the manufacturing mode, indicated by a value of `DEVICE_MANUFACTURING` (0x1) in the `CPTRA_SECURITY_STATE` register `device_lifecycle` bits.

#### UDS Provisioning
1. On reset, the ROM checks if the `UDS_PROGRAM_REQ` bit in the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_REQ` register is set. If the bit is set, ROM initiates the UDS seed programming flow by setting the `UDS_PROGRAM_IN_PROGRESS` bit in the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register. If the flow fails at some point past reading the REQ bits, the flow will be aborted and an error returned.

2. ROM then retrieves a 512-bit value from the iTRNG, the UDS Seed programming base address from the `SS_UDS_SEED_BASE_ADDR_L` and `SS_UDS_SEED_BASE_ADDR_H` registers and the Fuse Controller's base address from the `SS_OTP_FC_BASE_ADDR_L` and `SS_OTP_FC_BASE_ADDR_H` registers.

3. ROM then retrieves the UDS granularity from the `CPTRA_GENERIC_INPUT_WIRES` register0 Bit31 to learn if the fuse row is accessible with 32-bit or 64-bit granularity.  If the bit is reset, it indicates 64-bit granularity; otherwise, it indicates 32-bit granularity.

4. ROM then performs the following steps until all the 512 bits of the UDS seed are programmed:
    1. The ROM verifies the idle state of the DAI by reading the `STATUS` register `DAI_IDLE` bit (Bit-21) of the Fuse Controller, located at offset 0x10 from the Fuse Controller's base address.
    2. If the granularity is 32-bit, the ROM writes the next word from the UDS seed to the `DIRECT_ACCESS_WDATA_0` register. If the granularity is 64-bit, the ROM writes the next two words to `the DIRECT_ACCESS_WDATA_0` and `DIRECT_ACCESS_WDATA_1` registers, located at offsets 0x44 and 0x48 respectively from the Fuse Controller's base address.
    3. The ROM writes the lower 32 bits of the UDS Seed programming base address to the `DIRECT_ACCESS_ADDRESS` register at offset 0x40.
    4. The ROM triggers the UDS seed write command by writing 0x2 to the `DIRECT_ACCESS_CMD` register at offset 0x3C.
    5. The ROM increments the `DIRECT_ACCESS_ADDRESS` register by 4 for 32-bit granularity or 8 for 64-bit granularity and repeats the process for the remaining words of the UDS seed.

5. The ROM continuously polls the Fuse Controller's `STATUS` register until the DAI state returns to idle.

6. After completing the write operation, ROM triggers the partition  digest operation performing the following steps:
    1. The ROM writes the lower 32 bits of the UDS Seed programming base address to the `DIRECT_ACCESS_ADDRESS` register.
    2. The ROM triggers the digest calculation command by writing 0x4 to the `DIRECT_ACCESS_CMD` register.
    3. The ROM continuously polls the Fuse Controller's `STATUS` register until the DAI state returns to idle.

7. ROM updates the `UDS_PROGRAM_SUCCESS` or the `UDS_PROGRAM_FAIL` bit in the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register to indicate the outcome of the operation.

8. ROM then resets the `UDS_PROGRAM_IN_PROGRESS` bit in the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register to indicate completion of the programming.

9. The manufacturing process then polls this bit and continues with the fuse burning flow as outlined by the fuse controller specifications and SOC-specific VR methodologies.

#### Debug Unlock
1. On reset, the ROM checks if the `MANUF_DBG_UNLOCK_REQ` bit in the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_REQ` register and the `DEBUG_INTENT` bit in `SS_DEBUG_INTENT` register are set.

2. If they are set, the ROM sets the `TAP_MAILBOX_AVAILABLE` & `MANUF_DBG_UNLOCK_IN_PROGRESS` bits in the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register, then enters a loop, awaiting a `TOKEN` command on the mailbox. The payload of this command is a 256-bit value.

3. The ROM performs a SHA-512 operation on the token to generate the input token digest.

4. The ROM compares the `FUSE_MANUF_DBG_UNLOCK_TOKEN` fuse register with the input token digest.

5. The ROM completes the mailbox command.

6. If the input token digest and fuse token digests match, the ROM authorizes the debug unlock by setting the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register `MANUF_DBG_UNLOCK_SUCCESS` bit to 1.

7. If the token digests do not match, the ROM blocks the debug unlock by setting the the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register `MANUF_DBG_UNLOCK_FAIL` bit to 1.

8. The ROM sets the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register `MANUF_DBG_UNLOCK_IN_PROGRESS` and `TAP_MAILBOX_AVAILABLE` bits to 0.


### Production Flows
The following flows are conducted when the ROM is operating in the production mode, indicated by a value of `DEVICE_PRODUCTION` (0x3) in the `CPTRA_SECURITY_STATE` register `device_lifecycle` bits.

#### Debug Unlock
1. On reset, the ROM checks if the `PROD_DEBUG_UNLOCK_REQ` bit in the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_REQ` register and the `DEBUG_INTENT` in `SS_DEBUG_INTENT` register are set.

2. If they are set, the ROM sets the `TAP_MAILBOX_AVAILABLE` & `PROD_DBG_UNLOCK_IN_PROGRESS` bits in the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register.

3. ROM enters a polling loop, awaiting a `AUTH_DEBUG_UNLOCK_REQ` command (Id: 0x50445552) on the mailbox. The payload for this command is of the following format:

| Field            | Size (bytes) | Description                                        |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Length           | 4            | Length of the message in DWORDs. This should be 2. |
| Unlock Level     | 1            | Debug unlock Level (Number 1-8).                   |
| Reserved         | 3            | Reserved field.                                    |

3. On failure, ROM does the following:
      - `PROD_DBG_UNLOCK_FAIL` bit in `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register to 1.
      - `PROD_DBG_UNLOCK_IN_PROGRESS` bit in `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register to 0.

4. The ROM validates the payload and on successful validation sends the following payload as the response:

| Field                    | Size (bytes) | Description                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Length                   | 4            | Length of the message in DWORDs. This should be 21.|
| Unique Device Identifier | 32           | Device identifier of the Caliptra Device.          |
| Challenge                | 48           | Random number.                                     |

5. On failure, ROM sets the registers outlined in step 3.

6. The SOC then sends the following payload via the `AUTH_DEBUG_UNLOCK_TOKEN` mailbox command (0x50445554):

| Field                    | Size (bytes) | Description                                                                           |
|--------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Length                   | 4            | Length of the message in DWORDs. This should be 0x753.                                |
| Unique Device Identifier | 32           | Device identifier sent in `AUTH_DEBUG_UNLOCK_CHALLENGE` mailbox command payload.      |
| Unlock Level             | 1            | Debug unlock Level (Number 1-8).                                                      |
| Reserved                 | 3            | Reserved field.                                                                       |
| Challenge                | 48           | Random number sent in `AUTH_DEBUG_UNLOCK_CHALLENGE` mailbox command payload.          |
| ECC Public Key           | 96           | ECC P-384 public key used to verify the Message Signature <br> **X-Coordinate:** Public Key X-Coordinate (48 bytes, big endian) <br> **Y-Coordinate:** Public Key Y-Coordinate (48 bytes, big endian)                         |
| MLDSA Public Key         | 2592         | MLDSA-87 public key used to verify the Message Signature.                             |
| ECC Signature            |  96          | ECC P-384 signature of the Message hashed using SHA2-384. <br> **R-Coordinate:** Random Point (48 bytes) <br> **S-Coordinate:** Proof (48 bytes).                                                                                   |
| MLDSA Signature          | 4628         | MLDSA signature of the Message hashed using SHA2-512. (4627 bytes + 1 Reserved byte). |

7. On receiving this payload, ROM performs the following validations:
    - Ensures the value in the `Length` field matches the size of the payload.
    - Confirms that the `Debug unlock level` is not zero and does not exceed the value specified in the `SS_NUM_OF_PROD_DEBUG_UNLOCK_AUTH_PK_HASHES` register.
    - Calculates the address of the public key hash fuse as follows: <br>
        **SS_PROD_DEBUG_UNLOCK_AUTH_PK_HASH_REG_BANK_OFFSET register value + ( (Debug Unlock Level - 1) * SHA2-384 hash size (48 bytes) )**
    - Retrieves the SHA2-384 hash (48 bytes) from the calculated address using DMA assist.
    - Computes the SHA2-384 hash of the message formed by concatenating the ECC and MLDSA public keys in the payload.
    - Compares the retrieved and computed hashes. It the comparison fails, the ROM blocks the debug unlock request by setting the registers outlined in step 3.
    - Upon hash comparison failure, the ROM exits the payload validation flow and completes the mailbox command.

4. The ROM proceeds with payload validation by verifying the ECC and MLDSA signatures over the `Challenge`, `Device Identifier`, `Reserved` and `Unlock Category` fields within the payload. Should the validation fail, the ROM blocks the debug unlock by setting the registers outlined in item 3. Conversely, if the signature validation succeeds, the ROM authorizes the debug unlock by configuring the following settings:

      - `PROD_DBG_UNLOCK_SUCCESS` bit in `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register to 1.
      - Setting the Debug unlock level in the `SS_SOC_DBG_UNLOCK_LEVEL` register as one hot encoded value (1 << (Level - 1))
      - `PROD_DBG_UNLOCK_IN_PROGRESS` bit in `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register to 0.

5. ROM then completes the mailbox command with success.

6. The ROM sets the `SS_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG_RSP` register `PROD_DBG_UNLOCK_IN_PROGRESS` and `TAP_MAILBOX_AVAILABLE` bits to 0.

### Known Answer Test (KAT)

To certify a cryptographic module, pre-operational self-tests must be performed when the system is booted. Implementing KATs is required for FIPS certification. However, regardless of FIPS certification, it is considered a security best practice to ensure that the supported cryptographic algorithms are functioning properly to guarantee correct security posture.

KAT execution is described as two types:

* Pre-operational Self-Test (POST)
* Conditional Algorithm Self-Test (CAST)

ROM performs the following POST tests to ensure that needed cryptographic modules are functioning correctly and are operational before any cryptographic operations are performed:

 - SHA1
 - SHA2-256
 - SHA2-384
 - SHA2-512
 - SHA2-512-ACC
 - SHAKE-256 (conditionally, if not ROM feature)
 - ECC-384
 - ECDH (conditionally, if not ROM feature)
 - HMAC-384Kdf (conditionally, if not ROM feature)
 - HMAC-512Kdf
 - HKDF-384 (conditionally, if not ROM feature)
 - HKDF-512
 - KDF-CMAC
 - LMS
 - MLDSA87
 - AES-256-ECB
 - AES-256-CBC
 - AES-256-CMAC
 - AES-256-CTR
 - AES-256-GCM

### DICE Flow

![DICE Flow](doc/svg/dice-diagram.svg)

### Decrypt secrets

DICE Unique Device Secret (UDS) is stored in an SOC backed fuse (or derived from PUF). The raw UDS is not directly used. UDS is deobfuscated using Deobfuscation Engine. UDS is provisioned by the Silicon Vendor.

Field Entropy is used to mitigate certain classes of supply chain attacks.  Field Entropy is programmed by the owner of the device in a secure environment in the owner’s facility. Field Entropy programmed in fuses is not directly used. Field Entropy is put through the deobfuscation engine to randomize it.

Both UDS and Field Entropy are available only during cold reset of Caliptra.

**Pre-conditions:**

- Caliptra subsystem is being cold reset
- Obfuscation Key loaded in deobfuscation engine
- UDS and Field Entropy loaded in Caliptra Fuse Registers

**Post-conditions:**

- UDS Fuse Register and Field Entropy Fuse register cleared
- Obfuscation Key cleared from Deobfuscation Engine
- Vault State is as follows:

| Slot | Key Vault                |
|------|-----------------------   |
| 0    | UDS (64 bytes)           |
| 1    | Field Entropy (32 bytes) |

### Firmware Processor Stage
During this phase, the ROM executes specific mailbox commands. Based on the operational mode (ACTIVE versus PASSIVE), the ROM also initiates the download of the firmware image. This download is conducted either through a mailbox command or via the Recovery Register Interface.

#### Handling commands from mailbox

ROM supports the following set of commands before handling the FW_DOWNLOAD command in PASSIVE mode (described in section 9.6) or RI_DOWNLOAD_FIRMWARE command in ACTIVE mode. Once the FW_DOWNLOAD or RI_DOWNLOAD_FIRMWARE is issued, ROM stops processing any additional mailbox commands.

1. **STASH_MEASUREMENT**: Up to eight measurements can be sent to the ROM for recording. Sending more than eight measurements will result in an FW_PROC_MAILBOX_STASH_MEASUREMENT_MAX_LIMIT fatal error. Format of a measurement is documented at [Stash Measurement command](https://github.com/chipsalliance/caliptra-sw/blob/main-2.x/runtime/README.md#stash_measurement).
2. **VERSION**: Get version info about the module. [Version command](https://github.com/chipsalliance/caliptra-sw/blob/main-2.x/runtime/README.md#version).
3. **SELF_TEST_START**: This command is used to invoke the FIPS Known-Answer-Tests (aka KAT) on demand. [Self Test Start command](https://github.com/chipsalliance/caliptra-sw/blob/main-2.x/runtime/README.md#self_test_start).

#### Downloading firmware image from mailbox

There are two modes in which the ROM executes: PASSIVE mode or ACTIVE mode. Following is the sequence of the steps that are performed to download parts of firmware image from mailbox in PASSIVE mode.

- ROM asserts READY_FOR_FIRMWARE signal.
- Poll for the execute bit to be set. This bit is set as the last step to transfer the control of the command to the Caliptra ROM.
- Read the command register and ensure the command is FW_DOWNLOAD.
- Read the data length register and validate the value in it.
- Read N dwords from the mailbox DATAOUT register.  Execute the command.
- Once the entire data is processed, clear the execute bit.
  - This should be the last step. Clearing this bit transfers the control back to the originator of the command.
- On failure, a non-zero status code will be reported in the `CPTRA_FW_ERROR_NON_FATAL` register

![DATA FROM MBOX FLOW](doc/svg/data-from-mbox.svg)

Following is the sequence of steps that are performed to download the firmware image into the mailbox in ACTIVE mode.

1. On receiving the RI_DOWNLOAD_FIRMWARE mailbox command, set the RI PROT_CAP2 register version to 1.1 and the `Agent Capability` field bits:
    - `Device ID`
    - `Device Status`
    - `Push C-image support`
    - `Flashless boot`
    - `FIFO CMS support`
2. Set the RI DEVICE_STATUS_0 register, `Device Status` field  to 0x3 ('Recovery mode - ready to accept recovery image') and
`Recovery Reason Code` field to 0x12 ('Flashless/Streaming Boot (FSB)').
3. Set the RI RECOVERY_STATUS register, `Device Recovery Status` field to 0x1 ('Awaiting recovery image') and `Recovery Image Index` field to 0 (Firmware Image).
4. Loop on the `payload_available` bit in the `DMA Status0` register for the firmware image info to be available.
5. Read the image size from RI INDIRECT_FIFO_CTRL_1 register. Image size is in DWORDs.
6. Initiate image download from the recovery interface to the mailbox sram:
  a. Write the payload length to the DMA widget 'Byte Count' register.
  b. Write the block size with a value of 256 to the DMA widget 'Block Size' register.
  c. Write the source address to the DMA widget 'Source Address - Low' and 'Source Address - High' registers.
  d. Acquire the mailbox lock.
  e. Write DMA widget 'Control' register.
    - Set `Read Route` bits to 0x1 (AXI RD -> Mailbox)
    - Set `Read Addr fixed` bit.
    - Set Bit0 (GO)
  f. Read DMA widget `Status0` register in a loop if `Busy' bit is 0.
  g. Image is downloaded into mailbox sram.
7. Set RI `DEVICE_STATUS` register, `Device Status` field to 0x4 (`Recovery Pending (waiting for activation)`)
8. Loop on RI `RECOVERY_CTRL` register `Activate Recovery Image` field to wait for processing the image.
9. Set RI `RECOVERY_STATUS` register `Device Recovery Status` field to 0x2 (`Booting recovery image`).
10. Validate the image per the [Image Validation Process](#firmware-image-validation-process).
11. Reset the `RECOVERY_CTRL` register `Activate Recovery Image` field by writing 0x1.
12. If the validation is succesful, set the `DEVICE_STATUS` register `Device Status` field to 0x5 (`Running Recovery Image ( Recover Reason Code not populated)`)
13. If the validation fails, set the `RECOVERY_STATUS` register `Device Recovery Status` field to 0xc (`Recovery failed`) and `DEVICE_STATUS` register `Device Status` field to 0xF (`Fatal Error (Recover Reason Code not populated)`).
14. Release the mailbox lock.

#### Image validation

See Firmware [Image Validation Process](#firmware-image-validation-process).

### Derivation of the key ladder for Stable Identity

Stable Identity calls for a secret that remains stable across firmware updates, but which can ratchet forward when major firmware vulnerabilities are fixed. Caliptra ROM implements this feature in terms of a "key ladder".

The key ladder is initialized from the LDevID CDI during cold-boot. The key ladder length is inversely related to the firmware's SVN. Each step of the ladder is an SVN-unique key. The key for SVN X can be obtained by applying a one-way cryptographic operation to the key for SVN X+1. In this manner, firmware with a given SVN can wield keys bound to its SVN or older, but cannot wield keys bound to newer SVNs.

To comply with FIPS, the one-way cryptographic operation used to compute keys is an SP 800-108 KDF.

When the key ladder is initialized at cold-boot, it is bound to the lifecycle state and debug-locked. This ensures that the keys of the ladder will change across lifecycle or debug state transtions.

Across update-resets, ROM tracks the minimum SVN that has run since cold-boot. It ensures that the ladder's length always corresponds to that minimum SVN. The key ladder can only be shortened (and thereby give access to newer SVNs' keys) by cold-booting into firmware with a newer SVN and re-initializing the ladder.

#### Cold-boot

ROM initializes a key ladder for the firmware. LDevID CDI in Key Vault Slot6 is used as an HMAC Key, and the data is a fixed string. The resultant MAC is stored in Slot 2.

    KeyLadderContext = lifecycle state || debug_locked state

    hmac512_kdf(KvSlot6, label: b"si_init", context: KeyLadderContext, KvSlot2)

    Loop (MAX_FIRMWARE_SVN - (current firmware SVN)) times:

        hmac512_kdf(KvSlot2, label: b"si_extend", context: None, KvSlot2)

#### Update-reset

During update-reset, the key ladder initialized at cold boot is lengthened if necessary, such that its length always corresponds with the minimum SVN since cold boot.

    old_min_svn = [retrieved from data vault]
    new_min_svn = min(old_min_svn, new_fw_svn)
    [store new_min_svn in data vault]

    Loop (`old_min_svn` - `new_min_svn`) times:

        hmac512_kdf(KvSlot2, label: b"si_extend", context: None, KvSlot2)

### Alias FMC DICE layer & PCR extension

Alias FMC Layer includes the measurement of the FMC and other security states. This layer is used to assert a composite identity which includes the security state, FMC measurement along with the previous layer identities.

**Pre-conditions:**

- LDevID CDI is stored in Key Vault Slot 6
- LDevID MLDSA Key Pair Seed is stored in Key Vault Slot 4
- LDevID ECDSA Private Key is stored in Key Vault Slot 5
- Firmware Image Bundle is successfully loaded and verified from the Mailbox
- ROM has following information from Firmware Image Bundle
- FMC_DIGEST - Digest of the FMC
- FW_SVN - SVN for the firmware
- MANUFACTURER_PK - Manufacturer Public Key(s) used to verify the firmware image bundle
- MANUFACTURER_PK_INDEX - Index of the MANUFACTURER_PK in the firmware image bundle

**Actions:**

1. PCR0 is the Current PCR. PCR 1 is the Journey PCR. PCR0 is cleared by ROM upon each cold and update resets, before it is extended with FMC measurements. PCR0 and PCR1 are locked for clear by the ROM on every reset. Subsequent layers may continue to extend PCR0 as runtime updates are performed.

    ```text
    pcr_clear(Pcr0)
    pcr_extend(Pcr0 && Pcr1, [
        CPTRA_SECURITY_STATE.LIFECYCLE_STATE,
        CPTRA_SECURITY_STATE.DEBUG_ENABLED,
        FUSE_ANTI_ROLLBACK_DISABLE,
        VENDOR_ECC_PK_INDEX,
        FW_SVN,
        FW_FUSE_SVN (or 0 if `FUSE_ANTI_ROLLBACK_DISABLE`),
        VENDOR_PQC_PK_INDEX,
        PQC_KEY_TYPE,
        OWNER_PK_HASH_FROM_FUSES (0 or 1),
    ])
    pcr_extend(Pcr0 && Pcr1, MANUFACTURER_PK)
    pcr_extend(Pcr0 && Pcr1, OWNER_PK)
    pcr_extend(Pcr0 && Pcr1, FMC_TCI)
    pcr_lock_clear(Pcr0 && Pcr1)
    ```

2. CDI for Alias is derived from PCR0. For the Alias FMC CDI Derivation, LDevID CDI in Key Vault Slot6 is used as HMAC Key and contents of PCR0 are used as data. The resultant MAC is stored back in Slot 6.

    `Pcr0Measurement = pcr_read(Pcr0)`

    `hmac512_kdf(KvSlot6, label: b"alias_fmc_cdi", context: Pcr0Measurement, KvSlot6)`

3. Derive Alias FMC ECDSA Key Pair using CDI in Key Vault Slot 6 and store the generated private key in Key Vault Slot 7.

    `AliasFmcSeedEcdsa = hmac512_kdf(KvSlot6, b"fmc_alias_ecc_key", KvSlot3)`

    `AliasFmcPubKeyEcdsa = ecc384_keygen(KvSlot3, KvSlot7)`

    `kv_clear(KvSlot3)`

    Derive the Alias FMC MLDSA Key Pair using CDI in Key Vault Slot 6 and store the key pair generation seed in Key Vault Slot 8.

    `AliasFmcSeedMldsa = hmac512_kdf(KvSlot6, b"fmc_alias_mldsa_key", KvSlot8)`

    `AliasFmcPubKeyMldsa = mldsa87_keygen(KvSlot8)`

4. Store and lock (for write) the FMC ECDSA and MLDSA Public Keys in the DCCM datavault.

5. Generate the `To Be Signed` DER Blob of the ECDSA Alias FMC Certificate.

    `AliasFmcTbsEcdsa = gen_cert_tbs(ALIAS_FMC_CERT, LDevIdPubKeyEcdsa, AliasFmcPubKeyEcdsa)`

6. Sign the Alias FMC `To Be Signed` DER Blob with the LDevId ECDSA Private Key in Key Vault Slot 5.

    `AliasFmcTbsDigestEcdsa = sha384_digest(AliasFmcTbsEcdsa)`

    `AliasFmcTbsCertSigEcdsa = ecc384_sign(KvSlot5, AliasFmcTbsDigestEcdsa)`

7. Clear the LDevId Private Key in Key Vault Slot 5.

    `kv_clear(KvSlot5)`

8. Verify the signature of Alias FMC `To Be Signed` ECDSA Blob.

    `Result = ecc384_verify(LDevIdPubKeyEcdsa, AliasFmcDigestEcdsa, AliasFmcTbsCertSigEcdsa)`

9. Generate the `To Be Signed` DER Blob of the MLDSA Alias FMC Certificate.

    `AliasFmcTbsMldsa = gen_cert_tbs(ALIAS_FMC_CERT, LDevIdPubKeyMldsa, AliasFmcPubKeyMldsa)`

10. Sign the Alias FMC `To Be Signed` DER Blob with the LDevId MLDSA Private Key generated from the seed in Key Vault Slot 4.

    `AliasFmcTbsDigestMldsa = sha512_digest(AliasFmcTbsMldsa)`

    `AliasFmcTbsCertSigMldsa = mldsa87_sign(KvSlot4, AliasFmcTbsDigestMldsa)`

11. Clear the LDevId MLDSA key generation seed in Key Vault Slot 4.

    `kv_clear(KvSlot4)`

12. Verify the signature of Alias FMC `To Be Signed` MLDSA Blob.

    `Result = mldsa87_verify(LDevIdPubKeyMldsa, AliasFmcDigestMldsa, AliasFmcTbsCertSigMldsa)`

13. Store and lock (for write) the Alias FMC Certificate ECDSA and MLDSA Signatures in the DCCM datavault.

14. Lock critical state needed for warm and update reset in the DCCM datavault.

    `dccm_dv_store(FMC_DIGEST, lock_for_wr)`

    `dccm_dv_store(FW_SVN, lock_for_wr)`

    `dccm_dv_store(FUSE_OWNER_PK_HASH, lock_for_wr)`

    `dccm_dv_store(MANUFACTURER_ECC_PK_INDEX, lock_for_wr)`

    `dccm_dv_store(MANUFACTURER_PQC_PK_INDEX, lock_for_wr)`

    `dccm_dv_store(ROM_COLD_BOOT_STATUS, lock_for_wr)`

    **Note**: A value of 0x140 is stored on a successful cold boot.

<br><br>

![UNKNOWN RESET](doc/svg/unknown-reset.svg)

## Firmware image validation process

The basic flow for validating the firmware involves the following:

- Validating the manufacturer key descriptors in the preamble.
- Validating the active manufacturer keys with the corresponding hash in the key descriptors.
- Validating the owner key descriptors in the preamble.
- Validating the owner keys with the hash in the key descriptors.
- Validating the active manufacturer keys against the key revocation fuses.
- Validating the Manifest Header using the active manufacturer keys against the manufacturer signatures.
- Validating the Manifest Header using the owner keys against the owner signatures.
- On the completion of these validations, it is assured that the header portion is authentic.
- Loading the FMC and Rutime (RT) TOC entries from the mailbox.
- Validating the TOCs against the TOC hash in the header.
- On successful validation, it is assured that the TOCs are valid. The next step is to use the Hash entry in the TOCs to validate the image sections.
- Downloading the FMC Image portion of the firmware Image.
- Validating the FMC Image against the hash in the TOC entry for the FMC.
  - If this is a cold reset, the FMC version number should be stored in a register.
- Downloading the RT Image part of the firmware Image.
- Validating the RT Image against the hash in the TOC entry for the RT.
- On the successful completion of these validations, the entire image is validated.
- Indicating to the SOC of validation success by completing the mailbox command.
- On validation failure, reporting the appropriate error in the `CPTRA_FW_ERROR_FATAL` register and invoking the [error handler](#Error-handling)

### **Overall validation flow**

![Overall Validation Flow](doc/svg/overall-validation-flow.svg)

#### **Pre-conditions**

The following are the pre-conditions that should be satisfied:

- Caliptra has transitioned through the BOOTFSM and all the fuses that are required for the validation are already populated by SOC.
- The FUSES programmed by the soc are
  - fuse_vendor_pk_hash : This fuse contains the hash of the manufacturer key descriptors present in the preamble.
  - fuse_ecc_revocation : This is the bitmask of the ECC keys which are revoked.
  - fuse_lms_revocation : This is the bitmask of the LMS keys which are revoked.
  - fuse_mldsa_revocation : This is the bitmask of the MLDSA keys which are revoked.
  - fuse_owner_pk_hash : The hash of the owner public keys in preamble.
  - fuse_firmware_svn : Used in FW validation to make sure that the firmware image's SVN is good.
  - fuse_pqc_key_type: This bitmask specifies the enabled PQC key type for firmware validation, indicating either MLDSA or LMS.
- The SOC has written the data to the mailbox.
- The SOC has written the data length in the DLEN mailbox register.
- The SOC has put the FW_DOWNLOAD command in the command register.
- The SOC has set the execute bit in the mailbox execute register.
<br> *( NOTE: At this time the interrupts are not enabled. Writing a execute bit will not generate an interrupt. The validation and update flow will need to be invoked externally.)*

## Preamble validation: Validate the manufacturing keys

- Load the preamble bytes from the mailbox.
- Based on the firmware image type, the image includes an ECC key descriptor and either an LMS or MLDSA key descriptor within the preamble. The ECC descriptor encapsulates up to four ECC public key hashes, the LMS descriptor up to 32 public key hashes, and the MLDSA descriptor up to four MLDSA public key hashes.
- The firmware image, depending on its type, incorporates an ECC key and either an LMS or MLDSA manufacturing public key within the preamble. These constitute the active public keys.
- The fuse_vendor_pk_hash fuse holds the SHA2-384 hash of the ECC, and LMS or MLDSA manufacturing key descriptors.
- The key descriptors are validated by generating a SHA2-384 hash of the ECC and LMS or MLDSA key descriptors and comparing it against the hash stored in the fuse. If the hashes do not match, the image validation fails.
- Upon a successful hash match, the ECC, and LMS or MLDSA key descriptors are deemed valid.
- Subsequently, the active manufacturer public keys are validated against one of the hashes in the key descriptors. The specific hash for comparison is identified by the active key indices.

### Preamble validation: Manufacturing key validation

- fuse_ecc_revocation serves as the bitmask for revoking ECC keys.
  - If bit-n is set, the nth key is disabled. All other higher bits that are zeros indicate the keys are still enabled.
  - If all the bits are zeros, all ECC keys remain enabled.
- Ensure that the Active Key Index in the preamble is not disabled by the fuse_ecc_revocation fuse.
  - If the key is disabled, the validation process fails.
- Repeat the above procedure for LMS or MLDSA keys using the fuse_lms_revocation or fuse_mldsa_revocation fuses, respectively, for key revocation.

### Preamble validation: Validate the Owner key

- The preamble includes a designated slot for the owner ECC key and a slot for either LMS or MLDSA keys.
- The fuse_owner_pk_hash contains the hash of the owner public keys.
- The validation process for owner public keys involves generating a SHA2-384 hash from the owner public keys within the preamble and comparing it to the hash stored in the fuse_owner_pk_hash register.
- If the computed hash matches the value in fuse_owner_pk_hash, the owner public keys are deemed valid.
- If there is a hash mismatch, the image validation process fails.

## Preamble validation steps

![Preamble Validation Flow](doc/svg/preamble-validation.svg)

## Header validation

- Retrieve the header portion of the firmware image from the mailbox.
- Note that the header is the sole signed component, featuring two distinct signatures pairs.
- The first signature pair is generated using the active ECC and LMS or MLDSA manufacturing keys.
- The second signature pair is generated using the owner ECC and LMS or MLDSA public keys.
- To validate the header:
  - Compute the SHA2-384 hash of the header.
  - Verify the ECC manufacturer signature in the preamble against the computed hash.
  - If the ECC manufacturer signature is invalid, fail the validation process. If the ECC manufacturer signature is valid, apply the same procedure using the LMS or MLDSA manufacturer key.
  - Similarly, utilize the precomputed hash to verify the signature with the ECC owner public key. Repeat the process using the LMS or MLDSA owner key.

## Header validation steps

![Header Validation Flow](doc/svg/header-validation.svg)

## Table of contents validation

- At this point both the Preamble and the Header have been validated.
- Load the TOC entries (FMC TOC and RT TOC) from the mailbox.
- Compute the SHA2-384 hash of the complete TOC data.
- Compare the computed TOC hash with the hash embedded in the Header.
  - If the hashes match, the TOC data is validated.
- Ensure that Fw.Svn is greater than or equal to Fuse.Svn.

<br> *(Note: Same SVN Validation is done for the FMC and RT)

<br>

## Table of contents validation steps

![Toc Validation Flow](doc/svg/toc-validation.svg)

## Validating image sections

- Upon successful validation of the TOC, each image section corresponding to the TOC requires validation.
- The hash for each image section is encapsulated within the TOC data.
- Retrieve the FMC Image section. The offset and size of the section are specified in the TOC.
- Compute the SHA2-384 hash for the FMC image section.
- Compare the computed hash with the hash specified in the FMC TOC.
  - If the hashes match, the FMC image section is considered validated. If the hashes do not match, the image is rejected.
- Retrieve the RT Image section from the mailbox. The offset and size of the section are specified in the TOC.
- Compute the SHA2-384 hash for the RT image section.
Compare the computed hash with the hash specified in the RT TOC.
  - If the hashes match, the RT image section is considered validated. If the hashes do not match, the image is rejected.

## Image section validation steps

![Image Section Validation Flow](doc/svg/image-section-validation.svg)

## Differences in operating mode of the validation code

- The validation code operates in three modes.
  - Cold Boot Mode
  - Warm Boot Mode
  - Update Reset Mode
- Cold Boot Mode
  - Validation of the entire image is done using the steps described above.
  - Save the hash of the FMC portion of the image in a separate register.
  - Copy the FMC and RT image's text and data section in the appropriate ICCM and DCCM memory regions.
  - The data vault is saved with the following values:-
    - LDevId Dice ECDSA Signature.
    - LDevId Dice MLDSA Signature.
    - LDevId Dice ECDSA Public Key.
    - LDevId Dice MLDSA Public Key.
    - Alias FMC Dice ECDSA Signature.
    - Alias FMC Dice MLDSA Signature.
    - Alias FMC Public ECDSA Key.
    - Alias FMC Public MLDSA Key.
    - Digest of the FMC part of the image.
    - Digest of the ECC and LMS or MLDSA owner public keys portion of preamble.
    - FW SVN.
    - ROM Cold Boot Status.
    - FMC Entry Point.
    - ECC Vendor public key index.
    - LMS or MLDSA Vendor public key index.
- Warm Boot Mode
  - In this mode there is no validation or load required for any parts of the image.
  - All the contents of ICCM and DCCM are preserved.
- Update Reset Mode
  - The image is exactly the same as the initial image which was verified on the cold boot, except that the RT part of the image is changed.
  - We need to validate the entire image exactly as described in the cold boot flow. In addition to that, also validate the image to make sure that no other part (except the RT image section) is altered.
  - The validation flow will look like the following:
    - Validate the preamble exactly like in cold boot flow.
      - Validate the vendor public key indices from the values in data vault (value saved during cold boot). Fail the validation if there is a mismatch. This is done to make sure that the key being used is the same key that was used during cold boot.
      - Validate the owner public key digest against the owner public key digest in data vault (value saved during cold boot). This ensures that the owner keys have not changed since last cold boot.
    - Validate the header exactly like in cold boot.
    - Validate the toc exactly like in cold boot.
    - We still need to make sure that the digest of the FMC which was stored in the data vault register at cold boot
      still matches the FMC image section.
    - Store the minimum firmware SVN that has run since cold-boot in the data vault.
    - Ratchet the key ladder if necessary.
  - If validation fails during ROM boot, the new RT image will not be copied from
    the mailbox. ROM will boot the existing FMC/Runtime images. Validation
    errors will be reported via the CPTRA_FW_ERROR_NON_FATAL register.

## Fake ROM

Fake ROM is a variation of the ROM intended to be used in the verification/enabling stages of development. The purpose is to greatly reduce the boot time for pre-Si environments by eliminating certain steps from the boot flow. Outside of these omissions, the behavior is intended to be the same as normal ROM.

Fake ROM is only available in production mode if the enable bit is set in the CPTRA_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG (see section above).

**Differences from normal ROM:**

Fake ROM reduces boot time by doing the following:

1. Skipping the DICE cert derivation and instead providing a static, "canned" cert chain for LDEV and FMC Alias
2. Skipping the known answer tests (KATs)
3. Skipping verification of the FW image received - This can optionally still be performed, see CPTRA_DBG_MANUF_SERVICE_REG

**How to use:**

- Fake ROM is provided in the release along with the normal collateral.
- The image builder exposes the argument "fake" that can be used to generate the fake versions

To fully boot to runtime, the fake version of FMC should also be used. Details can be found in the FMC readme.
