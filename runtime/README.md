## Runtime Firmware environment

This section provides an overview of the Runtime Firmware environment.

### Boot and initialization

The Runtime Firmware main function SHALL perform the following on cold boot reset:

* Initialize the [DICE Protection Environment (DPE)](#dice-protection-environment-dpe)
* Initialize any SRAM structures used by Runtime Firmware
* Upload the firwmare to the Manufacturer Control Unit (2.0, susbystem mode only)

For behavior during other types of reset, see [Runtime firmware updates](#runtime-firmware-updates).

If Runtime Firmware detects that Caliptra was reset during the execution of an operation, Runtime Firmware calls `DISABLE_ATTESTATION` because the internal state of Caliptra may be corrupted.

### Main loop

After booting, Caliptra Runtime Firmware is responsible for the following.

* Wait for mailbox interrupts. On mailbox interrupt, Runtime Firmware:
  * Reads command from mailbox
  * Executes command
  * Writes response to mailbox and sets necessary status registers
  * Sleeps until next interrupt
* On panic, Runtime Firmware:
  * Saves diagnostic information

Callers must wait until Caliptra is no longer busy to call a mailbox command.

### Fault handling

A mailbox command can fail to complete in the following ways:

* Hang or timeout, which result in the watchdog firing
* Unrecoverable panic

In both of these cases, the panic handler writes diagnostic panic information
to registers that are readable by the SoC. Firmware then undergoes an impactless reset.

The caller is expected to check status registers upon reading responses from the
mailbox.

Depending on the type of fault, the SoC may:

* Resubmit the mailbox command
* Attempt to update Runtime Firmware
* Perform a full SoC reset
* Some other SoC-specific behavior

### Drivers

Caliptra Runtime Firmware will share driver code with ROM and FMC where
possible; however, it will have its own copies of all of these drivers linked into
the Runtime Firmware binary.

## Cryptographic Mailbox Commands (new in 2.0)

Cryptographic mailbox (CM) commands are a flexible set of mailbox commands that provide access to Caliptra's cryptographic cabilities.
This is meant for offloaded key storage and use, supporting protocols like SPDM and OCP LOCK.

These commands are not meant to be high-performance as they are accessed via mailbox commands.

CM itself does not provide any storage for the keys: when generated, they are returned to the caller in encrypted form, and must be passed back to be used.

These mailbox commands provide SHA, HMAC, HKDF, AES, RNG, MLDSA, and ECDSA services.

Note that while MLDSA and ECDSA keys can be imported, generated, and used in the cryptographic mailbox commands (i.e., `CM_*` commands) through CMKs, these keys are *NOT* tied DICE or DPE, so their use may be restricted for certain purposes.

MLDSA and ECDSA keys managed by DPE use the separate `ECDSA384_SIGNATURE_VERIFY`, `LMS_SIGNATURE_VERIFY`, and `MLDSA87_SIGNATURE_VERIFY` mailbox commands, which do not use the cryptographic mailbox system and are not managed by CMKs.

### Contexts

Several of the methods, such as SHA and AES, support contexts so that multiple users can have in-flight requests at the same time.

The contexts contain the internal structures necessary to resume operations to support data that may exceed the size of a single mailbox command.

These contexts are intended to be opaque to the user, and SHALL be encrypted and authenticated if they contain sensitive internal data.

### Keys

Cryptographic Mailbox Key (CMKs) are used to store keys. Certain commands generate and return a new CMK. Most commands that use CMKs will also return a new CMK, as it is necessary to track CMKs so that they are not used beyond any relevant limits for their key type.

They are returned from commands that generate keys and must be passed back to Caliptra to be used. These keys are encrypted and opaque to the mailbox caller.

Internally, the unecrypted CMKs have the following structure:

| **Name**      | **Bits** | **Description**                        |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| version       | 16       | CMK version. Currently always 1.       |
| length        | 16       | how many bits of key material are used |
| key usage     | 8        | represents which kind of key this is   |
| id            | 24       | ID number                              |
| usage counter | 64       | how many times this key has been used  |
|               |          | This MAY only be tracked for AES keys  |
| key material  | 512      | bits used for the key material         |

The encrypted CMKs have the structure:

| **Name**        | **Bits** | **Description**                |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| domain          | 32       | reserved                       |
| domain metadata | 128      | reserved                       |
| iv              | 96       |                                |
| ciphertext      | 640      | encrypted CMK data (see above) |
| GCM tag         | 128      |                                |

The total size of the CMK is therefore 128 bytes.

Only the encrypted CMKs will appear in mailbox messages.

The key used to encrypt the CMKs is randomized on reset, which means that CMKs cannot be used between resets.
The IV is a randomized 1-up counter that is incremented for every key created.

#### Key Usage

The internal CMK structure and several commands use a key usage tag to specify how a key can be used:

| **Value** | **Usage** |
| --------- | --------- |
| 0         | Reserved  |
| 1         | HMAC      |
| 2         | HKDF      |
| 3         | AES       |

#### Replay Prevention and Deletion

To prevent replay attacks, Caliptra will have a small table that maps a CMK's internal ID to its last known usage counters.
Whenever a CMK is used, this table is checked and updated.

This is necessary for AES-256-GCM in particular to ensure that keys are only used a certain number of times, as per [NIST SP 800-38D, Section 8.3](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-38D).
Only AES-256-GCM keys need to be tracked in this table, but other keys MAY be tracked as well.

This requires 96 bits of storage per AES-256-GCM key. These can stored as a sorted list in the DCCM.

## Manifest-Based Image Authorization

Caliptra's goal is to enable integrators to meet standard security requirements for creating cryptographic identity and securely reporting measurements through DICE and DPE Certificate chains and Caliptra-owned private-public key pairs. In addition, Caliptra 1.0 provides an `ECDSA384_SIGNATURE_VERIFY` command to enable an SoC RoT to verify its own FW signatures so that it can develop an SoC secure boot using Caliptra cryptography. Caliptra 1.1 expanded the verify command to a PQC-safe `LMS_SIGNATURE_VERIFY` command. In each of these cases, it is left up to the vendor to ensure that they build a secure environment for introducing and verifying FW integrity and authenticity and then executing mutable FW.

The Caliptra Measurement manifest feature expands on Caliptra-provided secure verifier abilities. The Measurement Manifest feature provides a standard Caliptra-supported definition to enable the following use cases for integrators, vendors, and owners.

* Caliptra-Endorsed Aggregated Measured Boot
* Caliptra-Endorsed Local Verifier

Each of these abilities are tied to Caliptra Vendor and Owner FW signing keys and should be independent of any SoC RoT FW signing keys.

Manifest-based image authorization is implemented via two mailbox commands: [`SET_AUTH_MANIFEST`](#set-auth-manifest), and [`AUTHORIZE_AND_STASH`](#authorize-and-stash).

### Caliptra-Endorsed Aggregated Measured Boot

Aggregated Measured Boot is a verified boot where one signed manifest attests to FW integrity of many different FW measurements. The authenticity of the FW is tied to the trust in the public key signing the measurement manifest, which is endorsed by the Caliptra Vendor and/or Owner FW Keys.

### Caliptra-Endorsed Local Verifier

A local verifier provides an authentication of SoC FW by matching SoC FW measurements with measurements from the Caliptra measurement manifest. In this case, the SoC RoT still has its own FW public-key chain that is verified by the SoC RoT, but in addition the SoC RoT introduces the Caliptra Measurement Manifest, which is endorsed by the Caliptra FW key pair. Caliptra provides approval or disapproval of the measurement of any FW back to the SoC RoT. This effectively provides a multi-factor authentication of SoC FW.

The Caliptra-Endorsed Local Verifier could be required by the owner only or both the vendor and the owner.

The main difference between Caliptra-Endorsed Aggregated Measured Boot and Caliptra-Endorsed Local Verifier is if the SoC RoT is relying on the Measurement Manifest for SoC Secure Boot services as opposed as using it as an additional verification.

### SoC RoT Enforcement of Measurement Manifest

In both use cases, the SoC RoT chooses to provide the Caliptra Measurement Manifest and to enforce the result of the authorization. Caliptra 1.x is not capable of providing any enforcement of measurements for SoC FW execution.

### Caliptra Measurement Manifest Signing Keys Authenticity

Caliptra 1.0 and 1.1 do not put any requirements on how the SoC RoT ensures integrity and authenticity of SoC FW other than requiring the SoC RoT to provide a measurement to Caliptra of any SoC FW before execution. Caliptra Measurement Manifest enables the SoC RoT to perform the integrity check through Caliptra-authorized FW signing keys.

### Unique Measurement Manifest Signing Keys

In order to reduce usage of the Caliptra FW Signing keys, the measurement manifest will be signed by new key pairs: one for the owner and possibly one for the vendor. These new key pairs are endorsed once using a single signature within the Measurement Manifest, thus allowing the measurement manifest keys to be used independently of the Caliptra FW signing keys.

### Caliptra Measurement Manifest Vendor Public Key Authenticity

The Measurement Manifest MUST have an endorsement by the Caliptra Vendor Public Key. In order to fulfill this requirement, the Vendor has 2 options:

* Vendor signing required: The Vendor creates a new Measurement keypair which will sign the measurement manifest and endorses the new public key with the Caliptra FW Vendor Private Key. The signature covers both the new public key as well as the flags field which indicates that the new Measurement Key Pair will be enforced.
* Vendor signing **not** required: Vendor leaves the Vendor public key as all zeros, and clears the flag which enforces vendor signing and then endorses these fields with a signature in the Measurement Manifest. In this case, the Vendor releases ownership of enforcing any specific FW in execution.

### Caliptra Measurement Manifest Owner Public Key Authenticity

Caliptra will always verify the endorsement of the Measurement Manifest Owner Public key and require that it signed the measurement manifest.

This feature is accomplished by having the SoC send a manifest to Caliptra Runtime through the `SET_AUTH_MANIFEST` mailbox command. The manifest will include a set of hashes for the different SoC images. Later, the SOC will ask for authorization for its images from the Caliptra Runtime through the `AUTHORIZE_AND_STASH` new mailbox commands. Caliptra Runtime will authorize the image based on whether its hash was contained in the manifest.

#### Preamble

The manifest begins with the Preamble section, which contains new manifest ECC and either MLDSA or LMS public keys of the vendor and the owner. These public keys correspond to the private keys that sign the Image Metadata Collection (IMC) section. These signatures are included in the Preamble. The Caliptra firmware's private keys endorse the manifest's public keys and these endorsements (i.e., signatures) are part of the Preamble as well.

#### Image Metadata Collection (IMC)

The IMC is a collection of Image Metadata entries (IME). Each IME has a hash that matches one of the multiple SoC images. The manifest vendor and owner private keys sign the IMC. The Preamble holds the IMC signatures. The manifest IMC vendor signatures are optional and are validated only if the Flags field Bit 0 is set to 1. Up to 127 image hashes will be supported.

#### Caliptra Measurement Manifest Keys Endorsement Verification Steps

When Caliptra receives the Measurement Manifest, Caliptra will:

* Verify the vendor endorsement using the Caliptra Vendor FW Public Key and compare with the vendor endorsement signature.
* If the vendor endorsement is invalid, the `SET_AUTH_MANIFEST` command will be rejected.
* If the vendor endorsement is valid, Caliptra will check if a vendor manifest measurement key is required:
    * If the key is required, Caliptra will trust the Vendor Public key that was just endorsed.
    * If the key is not required, Caliptra will not perform any more vendor verifications on this measurement manifest.
* Verify the owner endorsement using the Caliptra owner public key and compare with the owner endorsement signature.
    * If the owner endorsement is invalid, the `SET_AUTH_MANIFEST` command will be rejected.
    * Otherwise, the owner public key will be trusted and Caliptra will use it to verify the overall measurement manifest.

#### Measurement Manifest Version Number

A Measurement Manifest VN is used to ensure that some enforcement is possible if a progression of measurements is required. 32 bits of the existing unused `IDEVID_MANUF_IDENTIFIER` fuse (128 bits) can be repurposed for this. This can be accomplished by updating Caliptra's main specification to redefine the fuse definition and its usage from "Programming time" to "Field Programmable".

### FW\_LOAD

The `FIRMWARE_LOAD` command is handled by both ROM and Runtime Firmware.

#### ROM behavior

the firmware image that ROM will boot. This image includes Manifest, FMC, and Runtime
firmware.

and the associated DICE key is re-derived from the zeroed CDI.

This command is intended to allow the SoC to continue booting for diagnostic
and error reporting. All attestations produced in this mode are expected to
fail certificate chain validation. Caliptra MUST undergo a cold reset in order
to re-enable attestation.

### VERIFY_AUTH_MANIFEST

This command verifies the integrity and authenticity of the provided image manifest. Unlike `SET_AUTH_MANIFEST`, it performs validation only and does not persist the manifest in DCCM.

Command Code: `0x4154_564D` ("ATVM")

The input arguments are the same as the `SET_AUTH_MANIFEST` command.


### AUTHORIZE_AND_STASH

The SoC uses this command to request authorization of its various SoC images. This command has the option to receive the image hash directly from SoC or from an external source (e.g., SHA Acc).

The SoC uses this command repeatedly to ask for authorization to run its different images. The Runtime will verify that the image hash is contained in the IMC and will allow or reject the image based on that check. The command also enables stashing of the image hash by default with an option to skip stashing if needed. The SVN field is intended for anti-rollback protection.


Command Code: `0x4154_5348` ("ATSH")

### ENUMERATE_HPKE_HANDLES
### REPORT_HEK_METADATA
### GET_ALGORITHMS
### INITIALIZE_MEK_SECRET

## Mailbox commands: Cryptographic Mailbox (2.0)

These commands are used by the [Cryptograhic Mailbox](#cryptographic-mailbox-commands-new-in-20) system.

### CM_SHA_INIT

This starts the computation of a SHA hash of data, which may be larger than a single mailbox command allows. It also supports additional algorithms.

The sequence to use these are:
* 1 `CM_SHA_INIT` command
* 0 or more `CM_SHA_UPDATE` commands
* 1 `CM_SHA_FINAL` command

For each command, the context from the previous command's output must be passed as an input.

The `SHA_CONTEXT_SIZE` is always exactly 200 bytes long.

The maximum supported data size for the SHA commands is 4096 bytes.

Command Code: `0x434D_5349` ("CMSI")

Additional authenticated data (AAD) can only be passed during the `INIT` command, so is limited to the maximum cryptographic mailbox data size (4096 bytes).

The CMK must have been created for **HMAC** usage.

The CMK passed in should be the SPDM major secret CMK created for HMAC usage. The key and IV used for encryption shall follow the [SPDM 1.4](https://www.dmtf.org/dsp/dsp0274) section 12.7 derivation with `key_length` equal to 32 bytes and `iv_length` equal to 12 bytes.

```
EncryptionKey = HKDF-Expand(major-secret, bin_str5, key_length);
IV = HKDF-Expand(major-secret, bin_str6, iv_length);
bin_str5 = BinConcat(key_length, Version, "key", null);
bin_str6 = BinConcat(iv_length, Version, "iv", null);
```

The provided 64-bit message counter will be XOR'd with the IV to produce the message IV. The Secure SPDM standard requires the counter endianness flag to be little, but big endian is also supported to aid in compatibility with some implementations.

Note that it is **critical** that the same CMK and counter never be used more than once when encrypting or decrypting in SPDM mode as doing so could compromise the plaintext of the messages.

For the update and final operations, there are not any SPDM-specific commands; `CM_AES_GCM_ENCRYPT_UPDATE` and `CM_AES_GCM_ENCRYPT_FINAL` should be used.

Command Code: `0x434D_5345` ("CMSE")

Unlike in the standard AES GCM encrypt init command, the IV is *not* returned.

The encrypted and authenticated context's internal structure will be the same as for described in [CM_AES_GCM_ENCRYPT_INIT](#CM_AES_GCM_ENCRYPT_INIT).

### CM_AES_GCM_ENCRYPT_UPDATE

This continues an AES computation started by `CM_AES_GCM_ENCRYPT_INIT` or from another `CM_AES_GCM_ENCRYPT_UPDATE`.

| ciphertext     | u8[ciphertext size] |                                  |

The tag returned will always be 16 bytes. Shorter tags can be constructed by truncating.

### CM_AES_GCM_DECRYPT_INIT

Starts an AES-256-GCM decryption computation.

Currently only supports AES-256-GCM with a 96-bit IV.

Additional authenticated data (AAD) can only be passed during the `INIT` command, so is limited to the maximum cryptographic mailbox data size (4096 bytes).

The AAD and IV must match what was passed and returned from the encryption operation.

The CMK must have been created for **AES** usage.

### CM_AES_SPDM_GCM_DECRYPT_INIT

Starts an AES-256-GCM decryption computation in SPDM mode.

Currently only supports AES-256-GCM with a 96-bit IV.

Additional authenticated data (AAD) can only be passed during the `INIT` command, so is limited to the maximum cryptographic mailbox data size (4096 bytes).

The AAD must match what was passed and returned from the encryption operation.

The CMK must have been created for **HMAC** usage.

The CMK passed in should be the SPDM major secret CMK created for HMAC usage. The key and IV used for encryption shall follow the [SPDM 1.4](https://www.dmtf.org/dsp/dsp0274) section 12.7 derivation with `key_length` 256 and `iv_length` 96.

```
EncryptionKey = HKDF-Expand(major-secret, bin_str5, key_length);
IV = HKDF-Expand(major-secret, bin_str6, iv_length);
bin_str5 = BinConcat(key_length, Version, "key", null);
bin_str6 = BinConcat(iv_length, Version, "iv", null);
```

The provided 64-bit message counter will be XOR'd with the IV to produce the message IV. The Secure SPDM standard requires the counter endianness flag to be little, but big endian is also supported to aid in compatibility with some implementations.

Note that it is **critical** that the same CMK and counter never be used more than once when encrypting or decrypting in SPDM mode as doing so could compromise the plaintext of the messages.

### CM_ECDH_GENERATE

This computes the first half of an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange to compute an ephemeral shared key pair with another party.

Currently only supports the NIST P-384 curve.

The returned context must be passed to the `CM_ECDH_FINISH` command. The context contains the (encrypted) secret coefficient.

The returned exchange data format is the concatenation of the x- and y-coordinates of the public point encoded as big-endian integers, padded to 48 bytes each.

### CM_ECDH_FINISH

This computes the second half of an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange.

Currently only supports the NIST P-384 curve.

The context must be passed from the `CM_ECDH_GENERATE` command.

The incoming exchange data MUST be the concatenation of the x- and y- coordinates of the other side's public point, encoded as big-endian integers, padded to 48 bytes each.

The produced shared secret is 384 bits.

### CM\_DERIVE\_STABLE\_KEY

Derives an HMAC key that has a stable value across resets from either
IDevId or LDevId.

The (interior) value of the returned CMK will be the stable across resets as it is derived indirectly from the IDevId or LDevId CDIs.
The actual encrypted bytes of the CMK will *not* be the same, and
the encrypted CMK itself cannot be used across resets. So, the key
will always need to be re-derived after every *cold* reset.

If a key usage other than HMAC is desired, then the KDF or HKDF
mailbox functions can be used to derive a key from the returned CMK.

The `mfg_flag_gen_idev_id_csr` manufacturing flag **MUST** have been set to generate a CSR.

When called from ROM, if the CSR was not previously provisioned this command will return `FW_PROC_MAILBOX_UNPROVISIONED_CSR(0x0102000A)`.

When called from runtime, if the CSR was not previously provisioned this command will return `RUNTIME_GET_IDEV_ID_UNPROVISIONED(0x000E0051)`. If the ROM did not support CSR generation, this command will return `RUNTIME_GET_IDEV_ID_UNSUPPORTED_ROM(0x000E0052)`.

When the `mfg_flag_gen_idev_id_csr` flag has been set, the SoC **MUST** wait for the `flow_status_set_idevid_csr_ready` bit to be set by Caliptra. Once set, the SoC **MUST** clear the `mfg_flag_gen_idev_id_csr` flag for Caliptra to progress.

The `exported_cdi_handle` is no longer usable after calling `REVOKE_EXPORTED_CDI_HANDLE` with it. After the `exported_cdi_handle`
has been revoked, a new exported CDI can be created by calling `DeriveContext` with the `export-cdi` and `create-certificate` flags.

### EXTERNAL_MAILBOX_CMD

Command Code: `0x4558_544D` ("EXTM")

**Note**: This command is only available in subsystem mode in 2.1+.

Executes a mailbox command located at an AXI address.
This allows for executing mailbox commands that are larger than the mailbox allows.

This is currently mostly useful for FIRMWARE_LOAD (as part of an update) or SET_AUTH_MANIFEST.

The response is still written to the mailbox.

The checksum is over the EXTM command, *not* the command that is loaded over AXI.
That external command will still need its own checksum, if applicable.

| --------              | -------- | ---------------
| chksum                | u32      | Checksum over other output arguments, computed by Caliptra. Little endian. |
| fips_status           | u32      | Indicates if the command is FIPS approved or an error.                     |
| new_pl0_context_limit | u32      | Number of contexts assigned to PL0 after the reallocation                  |
| new_pl1_context_limit | u32      | Number of contexts assigned to PL1 after the reallocation                  |

This allows the user to reallocate the 32 DPE contexts between PL0 and PL1. By default, each gets 16 contexts.

**Note**: 2 PL0 contexts are used by Caliptra itself during initialization.

## Checksum

For every command except for FIRMWARE_LOAD, the request and response feature a checksum. This
mitigates glitches between clients and Caliptra.

The checksum is a little-endian 32-bit value, defined as:

```text
0 - (SUM(command code bytes) + SUM(request/response bytes))
```

The sum of all bytes in a request/response body, and command code, should be
zero.

If Caliptra detects an invalid checksum in input parameters, it returns
`BAD_CHKSUM` as the result.

Caliptra also computes a checksum over all of the responses and writes it to the
chksum field.

## FIPS status

For every command, the firmware responds with a FIPS status of FIPS approved. There is
currently no use case for any other responses or error values.

*Table: FIPS status codes*

| **Name**        | **Value**                   | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `FIPS_APPROVED` | `0x0000_0000`               | Status of command is FIPS approved                  |
| `RESERVED`      | `0x0000_0001 - 0xFFFF_FFFF` | Other values reserved, will not be sent by Caliptra |

## Runtime Firmware updates

Caliptra Runtime Firmware accepts impactless updates that update
Caliptra’s firmware without resetting other cores in the SoC.

### Applying updates

A Runtime Firmware update is triggered by the `FIRMWARE_LOAD` command. Upon
receiving this command, Runtime Firmware does the following:

1. Locks the mailbox to writes
1. Invokes impactless reset

After impactless reset is invoked, FMC loads the hash of the image
from the verified Manifest into the necessary PCRs:

1. Runtime Journey PCR
1. Runtime Latest PCR

If ROM validation of the image fails:

* ROM SHALL NOT clear the Runtime Latest PCR. It SHALL still re-lock this
  PCR with the existing value.
* FMC SHALL NOT extend either of the Runtime PCRs.

### Boot process after update

After an impactless update is applied, the new Runtime Firmware is
able to sample a register to determine if it has undergone an Impactless Reset. In
this case, the new Runtime Firmware must:

1. Validate DPE state in SRAM
    1. Ensure the TCI tree is well-formed
    1. Ensure all nodes chain to the root (TYPE = RTMR, “Internal TCI” flag is set)
1. Verify that the “Latest TCI” field of the TCI Node that contains the
   Runtime PCRs (TYPE = RTMR, “Internal TCI” flag is set) matches the
   “Latest” and Journey Runtime PCR values.
    1. Ensure `SHA384_HASH(0x00..00, TCI from SRAM) == RT_FW_JOURNEY_PCR`
1. Check that retired and inactive contexts do not have tags
1. If any validations fail, Runtime Firmware executes the
   `DISABLE_ATTESTATION` command

## DICE Protection Environment (DPE)

Caliptra Runtime Firmware SHALL implement a profile of the DICE Protection
Environment (DPE) API.

### PAUSER privilege levels

Caliptra uses PAUSER as a HW mechanism to distinguish DPE Client localities.
Caliptra models PAUSER callers to its mailbox as having 1 of 2 privilege levels:

* PL0 - High privilege. Only 1 PAUSER in the SoC may be at PL0. The PL0 PAUSER
  is denoted in the signed Caliptra firmware image. The PL0 PAUSER may call any
  supported DPE commands. Only PL0 can use the CertifyKey command. Success of the
  CertifyKey command signifies to the caller that it is at PL0. Only PL0 can use
  the POPULATE\_IDEV\_ECC384\_CERT and POPULATE\_IDEV\_MLDSA87\_CERT mailbox commands.
* PL1 - Restricted privilege. All other PAUSERs in the SoC are PL1. Caliptra
  SHALL fail any calls to the DPE CertifyKey with format=X509 by PL1 callers.
  PL1 callers should use the CSR format instead.

PAUSER and Locality map 1:1. Consequently, only the single DPE Client associated
with PL0 level, is authorized to invoke CertifyKey DPE command with format=x509.
All other DPE Clients have instead restricted privileges associated to PL1 (as
described above).

#### PAUSER privilege level active context limits

Each active context in DPE is activated from either PL0 or PL1 through the
InvokeDpe mailbox command calling the DeriveContext or InitializeContext DPE
commands. However, a caller could easily exhaust space in DPE's context array
by repeatedly calling the aforementioned DPE commands with certain flags set.

To prevent this, we establish active context limits for each PAUSER
privilege level:

* PL0 - 16 active contexts
* PL1 - 16 active contexts

If a DPE command were to activate a new context such that the total number of
active contexts in a privilege level is above its active context limit, the
InvokeDpe command should fail.

At boot Caliptra Runtime FW consumes part of the PL0 active contexts (initially 16) to DeriveContext for:
   - RTFW Journey (RTFJ) Measurement (1)
   - Mailbox Valid Pauser digest (MBVP) (1)
   - ROM Stashed Measurements (max 8)

Further, it is not allowed for PL1 to call DeriveContext with the intent to change locality to PL0's locality; this would increase the number
of active contexts in PL0's locality, and hence allow PL1 to DOS PL0.

### DPE profile implementation

The DPE iRoT profile leaves some choices up to implementers. This section
describes specific requirements for the Caliptra DPE implementation.

| Name                       | Value                          | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Profile Variant            | `DPE_PROFILE_IROT_P384_SHA384` | The profile variant that Caliptra implements.                                                          |
| KDF                        | SP800-108 HMAC-CTR             | KDF to use for CDI (tcg.derive.kdf-sha384) and asymmetric key (tcg.derive.kdf-sha384-p384) derivation. |
| Simulation Context Support | Yes                            | Whether Caliptra implements the optional Simulation Contexts feature.                                  |
| Supports ExtendTci         | Yes                            | Whether Caliptra implements the optional ExtendTci command.                                            |
| Supports Auto Init         | Yes                            | Whether Caliptra will automatically initialize the default DPE context.                                |
| Supports Rotate Context    | Yes                            | Whether Caliptra supports the optional RotateContextHandle command.                                    |
| CertifyKey Alias Key       | Caliptra Runtime Alias Key     | The key that will be used to sign certificates that are produced by the DPE CertifyKey command.        |

### Supported DPE commands

Caliptra DPE supports the following commands:

* GetProfile
* InitializeContext
* DeriveContext
    * **Note**: The "export-cdi" flag is only available in the locality of the PL0 PAUSER.
* CertifyKey
  * Caliptra DPE supports two formats for CertifyKey: X.509 and PKCS#10 CSR.
    X.509 is only available to PL0 PAUSERs.
* Sign
* RotateContextHandle
* DestroyContext
* GetCertificateChain

### DPE state atomicity

This implementation guarantees that no internal DPE state is changed if a
command fails for any reason. This includes context handle rotation; single-use
context handles are not rotated if a command fails.

On failure, DPE only returns a command header, with no additional
command-specific response parameters. This is in line with the CBOR-based
main DPE spec, which does not return a response payload on failure.

### Initializing DPE

Caliptra Runtime Firmware is responsible for initializing DPE’s default context.

* Runtime Firmware SHALL initialize the default context in “internal-cdi” mode.
* Perform the following initial measurements:
  * Call DeriveContext with Caliptra RT PCRs
    * INPUT\_DATA = PCRX (RT journey PCR as defined in the FHT)
    * TYPE = “RTMR”
    * CONTEXT\_HANDLE = default context
    * TARGET\_LOCALITY = Caliptra locality (0xFFFFFFFF)
  * Call DeriveContext with mailbox valid PAUSERS
    * INPUT\_DATA = Hash of [CPTRA\_VALID\_PAUSER register](https://chipsalliance.github.io/caliptra-rtl/main/internal-regs/?p=clp.soc_ifc_reg.CPTRA_MBOX_VALID_PAUSER%5B0%5D).
    * TYPE = “MBVP”
    * CONTEXT\_HANDLE = default context
    * TARGET\_LOCALITY = PL0 PAUSER
  * Call DeriveContext for each STASH\_MEASUREMENT call made during Caliptra ROM execution
    * INPUT\_DATA = `measurement` parameter to STASH\_MEASUREMENT
    * TYPE = `type` parameter to STASH\_MEASUREMENT
    * CONTEXT\_HANDLE = default context
    * TARGET\_LOCALITY = PL0 PAUSER

### CDI derivation

The DPE Sign and CertifyKey commands derive an asymmetric key for that handle.

DPE first collects measurements and concatenates them in a byte buffer,
`MEASUREMENT_DATA`:

* LABEL parameter passed to Sign or CertifyKey.
* The `TCI_NODE_DATA` structures in the path from the current TCI node to the
  root, inclusive, starting with the current node.

To derive a CDI for a given context, DPE shall use KeyVault hardware with the
following inputs:

* CDI = Runtime Firmware CDI (from KeyVault)
* Label = LABEL parameter provided to Sign or CertifyKey
* Context = `MEASUREMENT_DATA`

The CDI shall be loaded into KeyVault slot 8.

### Leaf key derivation

To derive an asymmetric key for Sign and CertifyKey, Runtime Firmware does the following:

* Derives an ECC P384 keypair from KV slot 8 CDI into KV slot 9
* For CertifyKey: Requests the public key
* For Sign: Signs passed data
* Erases KeyVault slots 8 and 9

### Internal representation of TCI nodes

| --------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x00            | 383:0    | `TCI_CURRENT`    | Current TCI measurement value                                                         |
| 0x30            | 383:0    | `TCI_CUMULATIVE` | TCI measurement value                                                                 |
| 0x60            | 31:0     | `TYPE`           | `TYPE` parameter to the DeriveContext call that created this node                     |
| 0x64            | 31:0     | `LOCALITY`       | `TARGET_LOCALITY` parameter to the DeriveContext call that created this node (PAUSER) |

### Certificate generation

The DPE Runtime Alias Key SHALL sign DPE leaf certificates and CSRs.

The DPE `GET_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN` command shall return the following certificates:

* IDevID (optionally added by the SoC via POPULATE\_IDEV\_ECC384\_CERT)
* LDevID
* FMC Alias
* Runtime Alias
